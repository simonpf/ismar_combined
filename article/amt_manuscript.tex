\begin{abstract}
  
  Accurate measurements of ice hydrometeors are required to improve the
  representation of clouds and precipitation in weather and climate models. In
  this study, a newly developed, synergistic retrieval algorithm that combines
  radar with passive millimeter and sub-millimeter observations is applied to
  observations of three frontally-generated, mid-latitude cloud systems in order
  to validate the retrieval and asses its capabilities to constrain the
  properties of ice hydrometeors. To account for uncertainty in the assumed
  shapes of ice particles, the retrieval is run multiple times while the assumed
  shape is varied. Good agreement with in situ measurements of ice water content
  and particle concentrations for particle maximum diameters larger than
  $200\ \unit{\mu m}$ is found for one of the flights for the Large Plate
  Aggregate and the 6-Bullet Rosette shapes. The variational retrieval fits the
  observations well although small systematic deviations are observed for some
  of the sub-millimeter pointing towards issues with the sensor calibration or
  the modeling of gas absorption. We find that the quality of the fit to the
  observations is independent of the assumed ice particle shape, indicating that
  the employed combination of observations is insufficient to constrain the
  shape of ice particles in the observed clouds. Compared to a radar-only
  retrieval, the results show an improved sensitivity of the synergistic
  retrieval to the microphysical properties of ice hydrometeors at the base of
  the cloud.

  Our findings indicate that the synergy between active and passive microwave
  observations improve remote-sensing measurements of ice hydrometeors and may
  thus help to reduce uncertainties that affect currently available data
  products. Due to the increased sensitivity to their microphysical properties,
  the retrieval may also be a valuable tool to study ice hydrometeors in field
  campaigns. The good fits obtained to the observations increases confidence in
  the modeling of clouds in the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator and the
  corresponding single scattering database, which were used to implement the
  retrieval forward model. Our results demonstrate the suitability of these
  tools to produce realistic simulations for upcoming sub-millimeter sensors
  such as the Ice Cloud Image or the Arctic Weather Satellite.

\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]

The representation of clouds in climate models remains an important issue that
causes significant uncertainties in their predictions \citep{zelinka20}.
Improving and validating these models requires measurements that accurately
characterize the distribution of hydrometeors in the atmosphere. At regional and
global scales, such observations can be obtained efficiently only through remote
sensing. Unfortunately, currently available remote-sensing observations do not
constrain the distribution of ice in the atmosphere well \citep{waliser09,
  eliasson11, duncan18a}.

To address this, the Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) radiometer, to be launched onboard
the second generation of European operational meteorological satellites
(MetOp-SG), will be the first operational sensor to provide global observations
of clouds at microwave frequencies exceeding 183 GHz. Compared to microwave
observations at currently available frequencies ($\leq 183\ \unit{GHz}$),
observations at and above $243\ \unit{GHz}$ have been shown to be sensitive to a
broader size range of hydrometeors \citep{buehler12} as well as their shape and
particle size distribution \citep{evans98}. Although the increased sensitivity
to smaller particles and their microphysical properties is expected to help
improve measurements of ice in the atmosphere, it also increases the complexity
of simulations of cloud observations, which are an essential tool for performing
these measurements in the first place.

In \citet{pfreundschuh20}, we have developed a cloud-ice retrieval based on
radar and passive sub-millimeter observations to investigate the potential
benefits of a synergistic radar mission to fly in constellation with ICI on
MetOp-SG. The simulation-based results from \citet{pfreundschuh20} indicate that
combining active and passive observations across millimeter and sub-millimeter
observations can indeed help to better constrain the distributions of ice
hydrometeors in cloud retrievals. The principal aim of this study is to validate
the synergistic retrieval using real observations and to investigate its ability
to retrieve the vertical distributions of ice hydrometeors.

Since the retrieval has been shown to work on simulated observations, the
validation of the synergistic retrieval essentially amounts to verifying the
physical realism of the underlying forward model. The observations from the
three flights considered here thus also constitute an opportunity to validate
the radiative transfer model that is used in the retrieval, i.e. the Atmospheric
Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS, \citeauthor{arts18}, \citeyear{arts18}) and
the corresponding ARTS single scattering database (ARTS SSDB,
\citeauthor{eriksson18}, \citeyear{eriksson18}), to accurately simulate cloud
observations at sub-millimeter wavelengths. Such simulations are of paramount
importance not only for future cloud retrievals from ICI observations
\citep{eriksson20} but also for assimilating cloud-contaminated observations in
numerical weather prediction models \citep{geer17}.


%So far, direct efforts to validate sub-millimeter radiative transfer through
%clouds at frequencies exceeding $183\ \unit{GHz}$ have been limited by the
%availability of such observations and the difficulty of accurately representing
%observed clouds and background atmosphere in the simulations. In the upper
%troposphere, observations of clouds have been obtained as by-products of
%space-borne limb-sounding missions aimed to study gases in the stratosphere.
%Retrievals of ice mass concentrations using sub-millimeter limb-sounding
%observations were developed for AURA MLS \citep{wu06}, Odin/SMR
%\citep{eriksson07} and SMILES \citep{millan13, eriksson14}. However, due to
%their geometry the observations are limited to very high clouds in the tropics.
%Other sources of sub-millimeter observations of clouds are airborne sensors with
%sub-millimeter channels such as the Millimeter-wave imaging radiometer (MIR,
%\citet{wang01}), the Compact Scanning Submillimeter Imaging Radiometer (CoSSIR,
%\citet{evans05}) and the International Sub-Millimeter Airborne Radiometer
%(ISMAR, \citet{fox17}). To the best knowledge of the authors, there are so far
%only two notable efforts to validate microphysical assumptions involved in
%sub-millimeter radiative transfer simulations: Firstly, the study by
%\citet{evans05}, who use a Bayesian retrieval to retrieve integrated radar
%backscatter of a convective anvil and achieve good agreement with simultaneous
%radar measurements at $90\ \unit{GHz}$. And secondly, the study by
%\citet{fox18}, who perform a closure study based on lidar and in situ
%observations of hydrometeors in a mid-latitude cirrus cloud.


In this study, the synergistic retrieval is applied to co-located radar and
microwave radiometer observations of three mid-latitude cloud systems. The
sensitivity of the retrieval to the ice particle shape that is assumed in the
forward simulations is tested by running the retrieval multiple times while
varying the assumed shape. To test the accuracy of the retrieval, retrieval
results are compared to in situ measurements of bulk ice water content (IWC) and
particle size distributions (PSDs) for the two flights where these were
available. Finally, we assess the consistency of the forward model simulations
by investigating the agreement between simulated and real observations as well
as between retrieved atmospheric state and in situ measurements.

The remainder of this article is structured as follows:
Section~\ref{sec:methods_and_data} provides a description of the datasets and
the retrieval algorithm upon which this study is based.
Section~\ref{sec:results} presents the results of the retrieval as well as the
comparisons to in situ data followed by a discussion of those results in
Sec.~\ref{sec:discussion} and conclusions in~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

The synergistic retrieval algorithm uses combined observations from radar and
passive microwave sensors to retrieve vertical profiles ice hydrometeor
distributions. The passive observations for this study are taken from the the
MARSS \citep{mcgrath01} and ISMAR \citep{fox17} radiometers on board the UK’s
BAe-146-301 Atmospheric Research Aircraft (FAAM BAe-146) aircraft. Since the
instrumentation of the FAAM BAe-146 aircraft does not include a cloud radar,
only flights for which the radiometer observations can be co-located with radar
observations from another platform are suitable for the combined retrieval.
Since ISMAR is currently the only operational radiometer with channels up to
$664$ and $874\ \unit{GHz}$, the flights considered in this study provide a rare
opportunity to study the synergies between radar and passive (sub-)millimeter
observations using real observations.

An overview of the three flights and the corresponding meteorological contexts
is provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:flight_overview}. The first considered flight,
designated B984, took place on 14 October 2016 as part of the North Atlantic
Waveguide and Downstream Impact Experiment (NAWDEX, \citet{schafler18}). During
this flight, a cloud system generated by an occluded front has been observed
quasi-simultaneously by three research aircraft: The High Altitude and Long
Range Research Aircraft (HALO, \citet{krautstrunk12}), the FAAM BAe-146 and the
Falcon 20 of the Service des Avions Francais Instrumentations pour la Recherche
en Environnement (SAFIRE). The two other flights, designated C159 and C161, took
place in March 2019 as part of the PIKNMIX-F campaign. These two flights were
performed following the ground track of simultaneous overpasses of the CloudSat
satellite. The observations probe clouds in different regions of a frontal
system generated by a low-pressure system passing over Iceland around 21 March
2019. The cloud system observed during flight C159 is a stratiform,
lightly-precipitating cloud located in the warm sector of the frontal system,
whereas the clouds observed during flight C161 are of convective origin and
located in the active region of the cold front. All datasets that were used in
this study are listed together with their sources in Tab.~\ref{tab:data}.

\subsection{Radar observations}

The radar observations from the three flights are displayed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:observations_radar}. Observations for flight B984 stem from the
HAMP MIRA radar \citep{mech14} onboard the HALO aircraft, which operates at a
frequency of $35\ \unit{GHz}$ and has been characterized and calibrated by
\citet{ewald19}. Its observations have been downsampled to a vertical resolution
of $210\ \unit{m}$ and a horizontal resolution of roughly $700\ \unit{m}$ in
order to reduce the computational complexity of the retrieval and to better
match the field of view of the passive observations, which, at an altitude of
$5\ \unit{km}$, vary between about $900\ \unit{m}$ for the low- frequency
channels and $200\ \unit{m}$ for the high-frequency channels.

The radar observations for flights C159 and C161 stem from the CloudSat Cloud
Profiling Radar (CPR, \citet{tanelli08}), which operates at $94\ \unit{GHz}$.
Since the CloudSat observations were affected strongly by ground-clutter, the
first five bins located completely above surface altitude were set to the
reflectivity found in the sixth bin above the surface. The CPR observations
have a vertical resolution of $240\ \unit{m}$ and a horizontal resolution of
about $1.4\ \unit{km}$. The horizontal distance between subsequent observations is
$1.1\ \unit{km}$.

    CloudSat CPR at $94\ \unit{GHz}$. The white line displays the ERA5 freezing
    level from \citet{era5}. }
  \label{fig:observations_radar}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{MARSS}

The MARSS radiometer measures microwave radiances at $89\ \unit{GHz},
157\ \unit{GHz}$ and channels located around the water vapor line at $183
\ \unit{GHz}$. Although MARSS is a scanning radiometer only observations within
$5\ \unit{^\circ}$ off nadir are used in the retrieval. The observations from
the three flights are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:observations_marss}.
Observations from channels that are sensitive to surface emission
($89\ \unit{GHz}$ and $157\ \unit{GHz}$) are excluded from the retrieval for
flight sections over land. The MARSS observations were mapped to the radar
observations using nearest-neighbor interpolation.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/fig03}
  \caption{
    Passive microwave measurements from the MARSS radiometer together with the
    matched radar observations. Grey background in the radiance plots marks
    observations that were taken over land.
    }
  \label{fig:observations_marss}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{ISMAR}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/fig04}
  \caption{
    Passive microwave measurements from the ISMAR radiometer together with the

    observations that were taken over land and are therefore not used in
    the retrieval.
    }
  \label{fig:observations_ismar}
\end{figure}

The ISMAR radiometer has channels covering the frequency range from
$118\ \unit{GHz}$ up to $874\ \unit{GHz}$. As for MARSS, only observations
within $5\unit{^\circ}$ degrees off nadir are used in the retrieval. The
observations from the 3 flights are displayed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:observations_ismar}. Similar as for the two low-frequency
channels of MARSS, the 4 outermost channels around the $118\ \unit{GHz}$ oxygen
line are not used over land. The matching of ISMAR observations to radar
observations is performed in the same way as for MARSS. It should be noted that
not all channels were available on all flights: The channels around
$448\ \unit{GHz}$ were not available on the B984 flight, while the two of the
channels around $325\ \unit{GHz}$ were missing for the C159 and C161 flights.
From the channels at $874\ \unit{GHz}$ only the V polarization was available
for flights C159 and C161.

The polarized measurements at $243\ \unit{GHz}$ and at $664\ \unit{GHz}$ for
flight B984 were replaced by the average of the measured H and V polarizations.
For flights C159 and C161, only the horizontally-polarized measurements at
$664\ \unit{GHz}$ were used used due to excessive noise in the V channel.

\subsection{in situ measurements}
\label{sec:in_situ}

in situ measurements of cloud hydrometeors were performed during the flights
B984 and C159. A detailed view of the high-level runs and the corresponding
in situ sampling paths are provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:flight_overview_detail}.
For flight C159, this view reveals a noticeable horizontal offset of $3$ to
$4\ \unit{km}$ between the ground track of radar and radiometer observations and
even larger deviations between the lower parts of the in situ sampling flight
path and the high-level run.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/fig05}
  \caption{

    paths for flights B984 and C159. The backound is the true-color composite
    derived from the closest overpasses of the MODIS \citep{modis} sensor
    on the Aqua satellite.
    }
  \label{fig:flight_overview_detail}
\end{figure}

The in situ measurements that are relevant to this study are bulk ice water
content measured using a Nevzorov hot-wire probe \citep{korolev13} and PSDs
recorded using DMT CIP-15 and CIP-100 probes, which measure size-resolved
particle concentrations with resolutions of 15 and $100\ \unit{\mu m}$,
respectively. The in situ measurements were mapped to corresponding radar
observations using a nearest-neighbor criterion.

An overview of the measured IWC and PSDs is provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:in_situ}.
While for flight B984 the measured IWC are mostly consistent with the radar
observations, there are clear disparities between the measured IWC and the CPR
reflectivities for flight C159. This indicates that there may be considerable
differences between the regions of the cloud that were sampled during the
in situ sampling and the part the was observed by the CloudSat CPR.

The PSD profiles for flight B984 show a clear size-sorting pattern with a
gradual decrease of the concentration of particles smaller than $200\ \unit{\mu
  m}$ and a simultaneous increase of the concentration of larger particles. For
flight C159, high concentrations of small particles are encountered at low
altitudes which decrease with altitude. For larger particles no systematic
variation with altitude is observed.

    of the co-located radar observations. The second row displays the variation
    of the mean of the in situ measured PSDs for different altitudes in the
    cloud.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Retrieval algorithm}
\label{sec:synergistic_retrieval}

The synergistic retrieval algorithm used in this study is based on the optimal
estimation framework \citep{rodgers00} and retrieves distributions of frozen and
liquid hydrometeors together with water vapor by simultaneously fitting a
forward model to the active and passive observations. Since the algorithm is
described in detail in \citet{pfreundschuh20} the following section only
outlines its main features and how it has been adapted to the flight data.

The retrieval input consists of a single radar profile and the corresponding
spatially closest radiometer observations. Background properties of atmosphere
and surface, such as temperature and wind speed, as well as a priori profiles
for relative humidity and liquid cloud water are taken from the ERA5 hourly
reanalysis \citep{era5}. The output of the retrieval are two parameters of the
PSDs of frozen and liquid hydrometeors as well as liquid cloud water content
(LCWC) and relative humidity. All retrieval targets and corresponding a priori
assumptions are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:a_priori}.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \caption{Retrieval quantities and a priori assumptions used in the retrieval.
    The relation for the a priori mean of $\log_{10}(N_0^*)$ is taken from
    \citep{cazenave19}.}
 \centering
\label{tab:a_priori}
    \begin{tabular}{c|l|p{5cm}|r}
     Quantity & Retrieved parameters & A priori mean &  A priori std. dev. \\
    \hline
    \hline
    Ice water content (IWC)
    & $\log_{10}(N_0^*)$
    & $-0.076586 \cdot (T - 273.15) + 17.948$ with $T$ temperature in $\unit{K}$
    & 2 \\
    & $D_m$
    & $\text{IWC} = 10^{-6}$
    & 500\ \unit{\mu m} \\
    
    \hline
    Rain water content (RWC)
    & $\log_{10}(N_0^*)$
    & 7 & 2 \\
    & $D_m$
    &  500\ \unit{\mu m}
    & 500\ \unit{\mu m}  \\
    \hline
    Cloud liquid water content (CLWC)
    & $\log_{10}(\text{CLWC})$
    & From ERA5
    & 1 \\

    \hline
    Relative humidity (RH) &
    $\text{arctanh}(\frac{2 \cdot \text{RH}}{1.1} - 1.0)$
    & From ERA5
    & 1 \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The retrieval forward model has been adapted to the sensors that were available
for each flight. The atmospheric grid was limited to altitudes between $0$ and
$10\ \unit{km}$ and matched to the resolution of the radar observations. The
latest stable release (version 2.4) of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer
Simulator (ARTS, \citet{arts18}) is used to implement the forward model used in
the retrieval. The built-in single-scattering radar solver of ARTS is used to
calculate radar observations and Jacobians. To account for the effect of
multiple scattering in CloudSat observations, the attenuation due to
hydrometeors is scaled at each atmospheric layer by a factor of $0.5$ following
Fig.~16 in \citet{battaglia10}. Passive radiances are calculated using the ARTS
interface to DISORT \citep{disort00} and their Jacobians are approximated using
a first order scattering approximation. Gaseous absorption is modeled using the
absorption models from \cite{rosenkranz93} for $N_2$ and $O_2$. Following
\citet{fox20}, absorption from water varpor is calculated using a combination of
the AER database v3.6 \citep{aer36} for resonant absorption and the MT-CKD model
version 3.2 for continuum absorption \citep{mlawer12}.

\subsubsection{Representation of frozen hydrometeors}

The forward model simulates active and passive observations in two steps: In the
first one, the bulk properties that are used to represent hydrometeors in the
retrieval are mapped to corresponding optical properties. The optical properties
are then, in the second step, used together with background atmosphere and
surface to simulate the observations.

The mapping of bulk to optical properties is based on a PSD and an ice particle
habit that associates particles of different sizes and shapes to optical
properties. More specifically, the forward model uses the normalized PSD
approach proposed by \citet{delanoe05} with the mass-weighted mean diameter
($D_m$) and intercept parameter ($N_0^*$) as parameters. The updated values from
\citet{cazenave19} are used as shape parameters of the distribution. The ice
particle habit is represented by a collection of ice particle shapes together
with corresponding, pre-computed optical properties. Bulk optical properties are
calculated by integrating the product of particle density and optical properties
over the particle size. As the retrieval is currently set up, the particle habit
cannot be retrieved and must be assumed a priori. Since this is difficult, a set
of habits has been chosen with which the retrieval will be run in order to
investigate the impact of the selected habit on the results.

Five particles were selected from the set of standard habits that is distributed
with the ARTS SSDB \citep{eriksson18}. The standard habits are particle mixes
that combine pristine crystals at small sizes with aggregate shapes at larger
sizes. The selected habits are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:particle_habits}. To
provide an overview of their optical properties, characteristic bulk optical
properties have been calculated and displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:particle_properties}
together with their mass-size relationships. The PSD used to calculate the bulk
optical properties is the same that is used in the retrieval with the $N_0^*$
value set to the a priori value at a temperature of $260\ \unit{K}$. The
particles were selected so that their properties cover most of the variability
of the available set of standard habits both in terms of the mass-size
relationship as well as their optical properties.

\end{table}

Complementary information that can help guide the selection of a suitable
particle shape can be obtained from in situ measurements. Since the particle
habit associates particle sizes with a specific shape it can be used to compute
a bulk water content corresponding to PSD measurements. This allows calculating
the IWC corresponding to the in situ measured PSDs, which can be compared with
the IWC measured by the Nevzorov probe. The agreement between the PSD-derived
IWC and the in situ measured IWC can then provide insight into whether the
mass-size relation corresponding to the particle shape is consistent with
that of the particles in the cloud. Such a comparison is provided in
Fig.~\ref{fig:mass_size_relation}.

For both flights, the Large Plate Aggregate and the 6-Bullet Rosette yield
the best overall agreement with the in situ measured IWC. The Large Column
Aggregate yields values at the low end of the measured distribution for all
flights and altitudes. The Evans Snow Aggregate yields similar results to those
of the Large Column Aggregate except at high altitudes for flight B984 and low
altitudes for flight C159. The 8-Column Aggregate generally yields higher IWC
values than most other habits and tends to overestimate the in situ IWC at low
altitudes for flight B984.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The primary results of the combined retrieval are the retrieved hydrometeor
distributions. In addition to that, the retrieval also fits a radiative transfer
model to the observations whose agreement with the real observations can provide
valuable information regarding the accuracy of the forward model and the fitness
of a priori and modeling assumptions.

\subsection{Fit to observations}

The retrieval residuals, i.e. the difference between simulated and real
observations, for the Large Plate Aggregate habit are displayed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:residuals}. As the figure shows, the retrieval was able to fit
both radar and radiometer observations fairly well for all flights. For flight
B984, the radar residuals show some scattered deviations located at the edge of
the cloud, which are likely discretization artifacts. Except for that, residuals
for this flight remain well within $1\ \unit{dB}$. The residuals for flight
C159, exhibit four vertical stripes with significant residuals in the radar
observations. In these regions, which correspond to significant scattering
depressions in most passive channels up to $325\ \unit{GHz}$, the simulations
overestimate the radar reflectivity. Apart from this, there are some smaller
regions where the simulations underestimate the radar reflectivity but these
remain limited to within few $\unit{dB}$. For flight C161, moderate negative
residuals in the radar observations can be observed in the right half of the
convective core, which coincide with an overestimation of the scattering signal
at $243\ \unit{GHz}$.

Radiometer residuals for flight B984 are mostly within $\pm 5\ \unit{K}$. For
the two other flights the residuals are larger. Differences up to and exceeding
$10\ \unit{K}$ are observed at the window channels up to $243\ \unit{GHz}$ as
well as in the outermost channels around the absorption lines at
$118\ \unit{GHz}$ and $183\ \unit{GHz}$. Since these correspond to profiles in
which residuals of opposite sign are present in the radar observations, a likely
explanation is that they are caused by small-scale precipitation events that are
missed by one of the sensors due to co-location issues.


\begin{figure}[!hbpt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/fig09}
  \caption{Differences between observed and fitted observations for the Large
    Plate Aggregate particle. First two rows depict the radar observations and
    their residuals, respectively. Following rows show the retrieval residual in
    the radiometer measurements for each of the frequency bands used in the
    retrieval. The grey shading marks sections of the flight path that were
    located over land surfaces. }
  \label{fig:residuals}
\end{figure}

For a more systematic analysis of the effect of the assumed particle shape on
the retrieval residuals, their distribution for radar and radiometer channels
around $183\ \unit{GHz}$ and above are displayed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:residuals_box}. The distributions, which for most channels are
close to or centered around zero, confirm that the retrieval generally fits the
observations well. The largest deviations are observed for the $874\ \unit{GHz}$
channel and the $243\ \unit{GHz}$ channel for flight C161. For flights C159 and
C161, the $874\ \unit{GHz}$ and $664\ \unit{GHz}$ channels exhibit small
systematic biases of opposite signs, which may indicate issues with the
calibration or the modeling of water vapor absorption at these channels.
Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the ice particle habit only has a
minor impact on the residuals indicating that the retrieval can compensate for
mismatches in the assumed particle shape by adjusting the retrieval variables.

  \caption{Distributions of retrieval residuals for different particle
    shapes used in the forward model for each of the three flights.}
  \label{fig:residuals_box}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Retrieved ice water content}

The retrieved bulk IWC and corresponding IWP for all three cloud scenes are
displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:ice_water_content}. For all three flights, the ice
particle shape has a significant effect on the retrieved amount of ice. In terms
of IWP, the Large-Column Aggregate and Evans Snow Aggregate habits yield the
highest values, while the 8-Column Aggregate consistently yields the lowest IWP.
The Large Plate Aggregate and 6-Bullet Rosette both yield values within the
range of the other particle models with the 6-Bullet Rosette leading to slightly
higher IWP values than the Large Plate Aggregate. In addition to the effect of
the increased total retrieved water content, the particle habit also has a small
effect on the vertical distribution of the ice hydrometeors, which is visible
particularly for retrieved IWC in the convective core observed during flight
C161.

    particle shapes assumed in the retrieval. The white line displays the ERA5
    freezing level from \citet{era5}.
  }
  \label{fig:ice_water_content}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Comparison to in situ measurements}

The most important question regarding the hydrometeor retrieval is certainly
whether the retrieved bulk properties are consistent with the in situ
measurements. As mentioned in Sec.~\ref{sec:in_situ}, the in situ measurements
were mapped to the radar observations using a nearest-neighbor criterion. For
B984, retrieval results within a distance of 1km of the flight path were then
associated to the in situ measurements. Because of the mismatch between
observations and in situ sampling paths, another approach was taken for flight
C159. Here the retrieval results were mapped to the in situ measurements by
selecting all retrieval results between $50$ and $150\ \unit{km}$ along-track
distance. Both, the matched retrieval results and the vertically-resolved
distributions of measured and retrieved IWC are displayed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:in_situ_iwc}.

For flight B984, the distribution of in situ measured IWC values is well within
the range of retrieved IWC values across all particle shapes up to an altitude
of around $7\ \unit{km}$. At these altitudes, the best match to the in situ
measurements is achieved with the 6-Bullet Rosette particle and the Large Plate
Aggregate. The 8-column aggregate underestimates the in situ-measured IWC while
Large Column Aggregate and Evans Snow Aggregate overestimate it. Above
$7\ \unit{km}$ all particles lead to results that underestimate the
in situ measured IWC. A likely cause for this is the high concentration of
small particles as observed in the in situ measurements (c.f.
Fig.~\ref{fig:in_situ}) for which microwave observations lack
sensitivity.

For flight C159, the distribution of retrieved IWC still covers the distribution
of in situ measured values for altitudes above $3\ \unit{km}$ but exhibits a
tendency towards underestimation. Overall, the differences between the results
for different habits are smaller for this flight. However, the uncertainties
caused by the large sampling region as well as the potential co-location issues
affecting the results make them less conclusive.

\begin{figure}[!hbpt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/fig12}
  \caption{in situ measured and retrieved IWC for flights B984 and C159. The
    first row of panels shows the in situ sampling paths in relation to the
    measured radar reflectivity as well as the retrieval values that are mapped
    to the in situ measurements (blue shading). The second row of panels shows
    in the background the distribution of in situ measured IWC values in
    altitude bins with a height of $500\ \unit{m}$. Colored boxes display the
    corresponding distribution of retrieved IWC values for different ice
    particle shapes. Boxes are drawn following Tukey's conventions for box
    plots. The colored triangles mark the mean of the distribution.}
  \label{fig:in_situ_iwc}
\end{figure}

Finally, we want to address the question whether the representation of cloud
microphysics within the retrieval forward model is consistent with the in situ
measured PSDs. For this, we calculate the PSDs corresponding to the retrieved
bulk properties and compare them to the in situ measurements. The results of the
comparison are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:in_situ_psds}. For flight B984, we
find good agreement between retrieved and in situ measured PSDs for larger
particles ($D_\text{MAX} > 200 \ \unit{\mu m}$) for the Large Plate Aggregate
and the 6-Bullet Rosette. Since this is observed even at altitudes above $6
\ \unit{km}$, it confirms that the underestimation of IWC at these altitudes is
likely caused by the high concentration of smaller ice particles. For flight
C159, the retrieved PSDs deviate significantly from the in situ measurements.
Although the 6-Bullet Rosette and Large Plate Aggregate seem to fit the tail
($D_\text{MAX} > 1 \unit{mm}$) of the PSD for most altitudes except between $3 -
4\ \unit{km}$, the measured PSDs deviate considerably at smaller sizes. This may
also indicate that the the assumed shape of the PSD may not be suitable for the
observed cloud system.

    measured PSDs (light grey) for a given altitude bin of a height of one
    kilometer. Colored lines on top show the corresponding mean retrieved PSD
    for different assumed particle shapes.}

\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

This study used a novel, synergistic retrieval to retrieve vertically-resolved
distributions of ice hydrometeors from co-located radar and microwave radiometer
observations. For most of the considered channels, the retrieval succeeded in
fitting both the active and passive observations without significant, systematic
deviations. For two of the flights, the retrieved hydrometeor distributions were
compared to in situ measurements. For one of the flights (B984), we found good
agreement with the in situ measured bulk IWC for altitudes between $2$ and
$6\ \unit{km}$ for two of the particle shapes. The same particle shapes also
yield the best agreements with the in situ measured PSDs for larger ice
particles ($D_\text{MAX} > 200\ \unit{\mu m}$). For the second flight (C159), no
consistency was found between the in situ-measurements and the retrieval. A
likely explanation for this is that the in situ measurements are not as well
co-located due to the temporal and spatial differences between the different
observations as well as the in situ measurements.

\subsection{Sub-millimeter radiative transfer in cloudy atmospheres}

 A first important result of this study is the ability of the retrieval to find
 atmospheric states that are consistent with the observed radiances and radar
 reflectivities for all three flights. This in itself is not self-evident due to
 the uncertainties that still affect the modeling of ice-particle scattering at
 millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. Previous studies that tried to
 directly validate sub-millimeter RT through clouds were either limited to
 tropical clouds \citep{evans05, eriksson07} or cirrus clouds \citep{fox17}. For
 flight B984, the radar and all passive observations were fitted up to small
 systematic biases no larger than $3\ \unit{K}$. The deviations for the two
 other flights were generally larger, but these were likely caused by spatial
 and temporal co-location errors. This indicates that both the assumed optical
 properties as well as the retrieval forward model are consistent across the
 considered wavelengths. Furthermore, the two particle shapes for which he best
 agreement between retrieved and in situ measured hydrometeor distributions was
 found for flight B984, were also those whose mass-size relationship yielded the
 best agreement between in situ measurements of IWC and PSDs. Since this ties
 the microphysical properties of the particles to their optical properties, it
 suggests that the modeling of these particles in the ARTS SSDB is physically
 consistent.

\subsection{The impact of assumed ice particle shape}

A rather unexpected result that emerged from this study is that the retrieval
can fit the observations regardless of the assumed ice particle shape. This
indicates that although the observations are sensitive to variations in ice
particle shape, they alone cannot constrain it. This is in agreement with what
has been reported in \citet{pfreundschuh20}, namely that no correlation could be
found between the particle shape yielding best retrieval fit and the one
yielding the most accurate retrieval results.

In an effort to better separate a potential signal from the ice particle shape
in the retrieval residuals, Fig.~\ref{fig:residuals_scatter} in the appendix
displays the relation between IWP and corresponding residuals in the $325 \pm
3.5 \unit{GHz}$ channel. This channel was chosen because it belongs to the
channels displaying the largest differences between residual distributions for
different particle habits (Fig.~\ref{fig:residuals_box}). Nonetheless, the
plots exhibit no sign of a relationship between either residual and ice
water content or the residuals across different habits.

This result implies that future ice hydrometeor retrievals that make use of
millimeter and sub-millimeter microwave observations must either account for the
uncertainty caused by variations in ice particle shape or find ways to more
accurately constrain the shape a priori. Moreover, for studies that seek to
validate model predictions by comparing simulated and observed microwave
observations, this implies that care must be taken to accurately characterize
the ice particle shape. This is because consistency between simulations and
observations can be achieved for bulk water contents that vary by almost an order of
magnitude (c.f. Fig.~\ref{fig:ice_water_content}).

\subsection{Representation of cloud microphysics}

The lack of a signal that constrains the ice particle shape even in the combined
observations puts additional weight on the question of how to best represent ice
particles in simulations of microwave observations. The habits that lead to the
most accurate retrieval results in this study were the Large Plate Aggregate and
the 6-Bullet Rosette. It is interesting to note that the Large Plate Aggregate
was also found to yield the best agreement between NWP-model-based simulations
and satellite observations at frequencies between $19$ and $190\ \unit{GHz}$ for
stratiform snow in \citet{geer21}.

Nonetheless, these findings are based on observations from the single flight for
which the retrieval results could be reliably compared with in situ
measurements. This result can thus be seen as indication that these habits may
work well for similar mid-latitude cloud systems but more generally applicable
conclusions would require further and more systematic investigation.

\subsection{Retrieval validation}

Since the results presented in \citet{pfreundschuh20} were limited to
simulations based on a high-resolution climate model, the validation of the
retrieval using real observations remained an open issue. For flight, B984 good
agreement was found between retrieval results and in situ measurements. Although
the retrieved IWC deviates from the in situ measurements at altitudes $>
6\ \unit{km}$, the retrieved PSDs still match the in situ measurements well for
particles with $D_\text{MAX} > 200\ \unit{\mu m}$. This indicates that the
observed deviations are due to the presence of a large number of small ice
particles that the microwave observations are not sensitive to. Although
\citet{oshea21} and \citet{oshea19} show that the occurence of high particle
concentrations at sizes below $200\ \unit{\mu m}$ may be due to measurement
inaccuracies of the CIP-15 probe, the measured PSDs correctly reproduce the
measured IWC at these altitudes when the corresponding water content is
calculated using any of the tested particle habits
(Fig.~\ref{fig:mass_size_relation}). Furthermore, the presence of a cloud layer
with a large number of small particles was also reported by \citet{ewald21} who
investigated the same cloud system with combined radar-lidar observations.

For flight C159 no good agreement was found between retrieved and in situ
measured IWC and PSDs. However, some evidence suggest that this may be due to
co-location: Firstly, the flight path for the in situ sampling was found to be
offset from the high-level run during which the observations were taken in the
direction opposite to the wind at $800\ \unit{mb}$
(Fig.~\ref{fig:flight_overview}, Fig.~\ref{fig:flight_overview_detail}).
Secondly, the a clear backscattering signal is present in the CloudSat CPR
observations even in regions where only negligible amounts of IWC are present in
the in situ measurements (Fig.~\ref{fig:in_situ_iwc}). Thirdly, the residuals
observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:residuals} are indicative of additional co-location
issues between radar and radiometer observations. Finally, also the
comparison of retrieved and in situ measured PSDs (Fig.~\ref{fig:in_situ_psds})
seems to indicate large deviations between the observed and the assumed PSD
shape.

\subsection{The added value synergistic cloud retrievals}

Although the evidence from flight B984 suggests that the synergistic
retrieval algorithm works well for retrieving ice hydrometeor concentrations,
similar retrievals can be performed using only radar observations. A retrieval
using only radar observations has the obvious advantage of requiring only
a single sensor and being computationally much less complex. This naturally
leads to the question of the added value that a synergistic retrieval
can provide.

To investigate this, the results of the combined and an equivalent radar-only
retrieval for flight B984 are displayed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:in_situ_iwc_radar_only}. For the Large Plate Aggregate and
6-Bullet-Rosette habits, the results of the combined and the radar-only
retrieval are largely similar down to an altitude of about $3.5\ \unit{km}$
below which the radar-only retrieval tends to overestimate the in situ IWC. In
contrast to the combined retrieval, the results of the radar-only retrieval
exhibit almost no impact from the particle habit. So while the radar-only
retrieval remains mostly unaffected by the habit choice, using a different habit
in the combined retrieval may cause systematic overestimation (Evans Snow
Aggregate and Large Column Aggregate) or underestimation (8-Column Aggregate).

\begin{figure}[!hbpt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/fig14}
  \caption{in situ measured and retrieved PSDs for flight B984
    for the combined and the radar-only retrieval. Each panel displays
    the distributions of in situ measured IWC for different altitude
    bins in the background and the distribution of retrieved IWC values
    for different ice habits as colored boxes on top.}
  \label{fig:in_situ_iwc_radar_only}
\end{figure}

A similar comparison is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:in_situ_psds_radar_only} for the
retrieved PSDs. The PSDs are largely similar for both retrievals for altitudes
above $4\ \unit{km}$. Below that, however, the radar-only retrieval
overestimates the particle concentrations, while the combined retrieval matches
the in situ measurements well for the Large Plate Aggregate and 6-Bullet Rosette
habits. This indicates that the combined retrieval utilizes the complementary
information in the radar and passive observations to match both moments of the
PSD, whereas the radar-only retrieval can only match one of them.

\begin{figure}[!hbpt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/fig15}
  \caption{in situ measured and retrieved PSDs for flight B984

    (panel (b)). Each row of panels shows the mean of the in situ measured
    PSDs (black) together with randomly drawn samples of measured PSDs
    (light grey) for a given altitude bin of a height of one kilometer.
    Colored lines on top show the corresponding mean retrieved PSD for
    different assumed particle shapes.}
  \label{fig:in_situ_psds_radar_only}
\end{figure}

These results thus suggest that combining radar with passive microwave
observations helps to constrain the PSD of ice hydrometeors for sufficiently
large particle sizes ($D_\text{MAX} > 200\ \unit{\mu m}$). Since for air- and
space-borne observations only microwave observations can sense the base of thick
clouds, this is a unique synergy between these types of observations.

\subsection{Limitations}

Since microwave radiative transfer simulations in cloudy atmospheres remain a
challenging problem, it is important to also consider the limitations of the
simulations and derived results that were presented in this study. The
simplifications that were applied in the simulations are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Horizontal photon transport between the retrieved profiles is ignored.
  \item Inhomogeneity across the radar and radiometer beams is ignored.
  \item The finite spectral resolution of the passive channels is neglected.
  \item The radar solver neglects multiple scattering.
  \item The effects of particle orientation are ignored.
\end{enumerate}

\citet{barlakas20} found that neglecting photon transport in simulations of
sub-millimeter observations across a footprint of $6\ \unit{km}$ incurs only a
small random error with biases $< 0.5\ \unit{K}$, so it is likely also small for
the simulations presented here. For flight B984, the horizontal averaging of the
radar observations leads to a profile width of $700\ \unit{m}$ which is fairly
close to the width of the radiometer field of views which varies between about
$900$ and $200\ \unit{m}$ at an altitude of $5\ \unit{km}$. The effect of beam
inhomogeneity is therefore expected to be small for this flight. For flights
C159 and C161, the radar beam has an along-track width of about
$1.4\ \unit{km}$, which is larger than that of the radiometers, so these
observations may be affected to a larger extent than those for flight B984.

Neglecting the finite spectral resolution of the passive channels can lead to an
error of up to $2.1\ \unit{K}$ for satellite observations that are affected by
Ozone absorption \citep{eriksson20}. Since the passive observations used in this
study were all taken from altitudes below $10\ \unit{km}$ the effect of this
approximation is likely negligible.

The effect of multiple scattering for air-borne radar observations is generally
negligible \citep{battaglia10}. For CloudSat observations, however, the higher
frequency and the considerably wider footprint will increase the effects of
multiple scattering on the observations. Although the simulations account for
the signal-enhancing effect of multiple scattering by layer-wise reduction of
the attenuation, the presence of multiple scattering may still add to the
uncertainty in the simulations for flights C159 and C161.

Finally, there is the potential presence of oriented particles in the cloud. The
different ice habits used in this study all assume totally random orientation of
the ice particles. Systematic vertical orientation of particles of a given shape
in the cloud would effectively alter their scattering properties. For
observations at nadir, particle orientation can increase the extinction of the
Large Plate Aggregate of up to $20\ \unit{\%}$ \citep{barlakas21}. To first
order, the increase in extinction can be expected to cause a similar
overestimation of the retrieved IWC. This, however, is still considerably lower
than the differences observed due to different ice habits.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

The main result from the experiments presented in this study is that we were
able to find two ice particle shapes, the Large Plate Aggregate and the 6-Bullet
Rosette, for which the results of the combined retrieval were consistent with
the observations as well as the in situ measured IWC and PSDs for flight B984.
Considering the co-location issues that likely affected the other two flights,
we interpret this as a cautious indication of the validity of the retrieval
implementation. Since the ARTS radiative transfer model and optical properties
from the ARTS single-scattering database constitute a crucial component of the
retrieval, this result also indicates that they work reliably across the
millimeter- and sub-millimeter domain.

The results confirm the simulation-based findings from \citep{pfreundschuh20},
that a synergistic retrieval based on active and passive microwave observations
can help to better characterize the PSD of large ice hydrometeors ($D_\text{MAX}
> 200\ \unit{\mu m}$) than a radar-only retrieval alone. This indicates that
such retrievals can be used to study the microphysical properties of clouds and
thus help to improve their representation in weather and climate models.

However, the retrieval is at the same time very sensitive to the assumed ice
particle habit that is used in the retrieval forward model. We found no evidence
of a signal that could help to constrain the ice particle shape based solely on
the combination of radar and microwave observations, not even when
sub-millimeter observations are included. This means that more work is needed to
better constrain the shape a priori or that even more observations must be
integrated into the retrieval.

Although further work will be required, this study demonstrates the feasibility
and potential of synergistic retrievals of ice hydrometeors by combining active
and passive observations at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. Since the
combined retrieval can better constrain the PSD of ice hydrometeors, it may be a
useful tool to study the representation of clouds in NWP and climate models.
Additionally, as illustrated in this study, the retrieval can be used to study
the representation of ice hydrometeors in radiative transfer simulations, which
will be vital to many applications of observations from upcoming sub-millimeter
sensors such as ICI and the Arctic Weather Satellite
\citep{arctic_weather_satellite}.
