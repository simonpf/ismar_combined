\begin{abstract}
  
  Accurate measurements of ice hydrometeors are required to improve the
  representation of clouds and precipitation in weather and climate models. In
  this study, a recently developed, synergistic retrieval algorithm that
  combines radar with passive millimeter and sub-millimeter observations is
  applied to observations of three frontally-generated, mid-latitude cloud
  systems in order to validate the retrieval implementation and asses the
  capability of the retrieval to constrain the properties ice hydrometeors. Good
  agreement with in-situ measurements of ice water content and particle
  concentrations for particle maximum diameters $> 200\ \unit{\mu m}$ is found
  for one of the flights. The variational retrieval fits the observations well
  for most channels, which serves as a validation of the sub-millimeter
  radiative transfer modeling of cloudy atmospheres. Moreover, we find that the
  quality of the fit to the observations is independent of the assumed ice
  particle shape, indicating that the employed combination of observations is
  insufficient to constrain the shape of ice particles in the observed clouds.
  The results do indicate an improved sensitivity of the synergistic retrieval
  to the cloud-microphysical properties of the cloud compared to a radar-only
  retrieval.

  This study serves as a validation of the synergistic retrieval algorithm and
  the underlying radiative transfer calculations. Our results indicate that,
  given a suitable representation of ice hydrometeors in the forward model, the
  combined observations from radar and microwave radiometers allow the retrieval
  to better constrain the distribution ice-hydrometeors especially in the lower
  parts of the cloud. Applied to airborne observations from field campaigns or
  as part of a future satellite mission, these type of retrievals could help to
  improve measurements of ice-hydrometeors. The good fits obtained to the
  observations further increase confidence in the modeling of clouds in the
  Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator and the corresponding single
  scattering database, which were used to implement the retrieval forward model.
  Our results demonstrate the suitability of these tools to produce realistic
  simulations for upcoming sub-millimeter sensors such as the Ice Cloud Image or
  the Arctic Weather Satellite.

\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]

The representation of clouds in climate models remains an important issue that
causes significant uncertainties in their predictions \citep{zelinka20}.
Improving and validating these models requires measurements that accurately
characterize the distribution of hydrometeors in the atmosphere. At regional and
global scales, such observations can be obtained efficiently only through remote
sensing. Unfortunately, currently available remote-sensing observations do not
constrain the distribution of ice in the atmosphere well \citep{waliser09,
  eliasson11, duncan18a}.

To address this, the Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) radiometer, to be launched onboard
the second generation of European operational meteorological satellites
(MetOp-SG), will be the first operational sensor to provide global observations
of clouds at microwave frequencies exceeding 183 GHz. Compared to microwave
observations at currently available frequencies ($\leq 183\ \unit{GHz}$),
observations at and above $243\ \unit{GHz}$ have been shown to be sensitive to a
broader size range of hydrometeors \citep{buehler12} as well as their shape and
particle size distribution \citep{evans98}. Although the increased sensitivity
to smaller particles and their microphysical properties is expected to help
improve measurements of ice in the atmosphere, it also increases the complexity
of simulations of cloud observations, which are an essential tool to perform
these measurements in the first place.

In \citet{pfreundschuh20}, we have developed a cloud-ice retrieval based on
radar and passive sub-millimeter observations to investigate the potential
benefits of a synergistic radar mission to fly in constellation with ICI on
MetOp-SG. The simulation-based results from \citet{pfreundschuh20} indicate that
combining active and passive observations across millimeter and sub-millimeter
observations can indeed help to better constrain the distributions of ice
hydrometeors in cloud retrievals. The principal aim of this study is to validate
the synergistic retrieval using real observations and to investigate its
potential applications in flight campaigns to characterize distributions of ice
hydrometeors.

Since the retrieval has been shown to work on simulated observations, the
validation of the synergistic retrieval essentially amounts to verifying the
physical realism of the underlying forward model. The observations from the
three flights thus also constitute an opportunity to validate the capability of
the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS, \citeauthor{arts18},
\citeyear{arts18}) and the corresponding ARTS single scattering database (ARTS
SSDB, \citeauthor{eriksson18}, \citeyear{eriksson18}) to accurately simulate
cloud observations at sub-millimeter wavelengths. These simulations are of
paramount importance not only for future cloud retrievals from ICI observations
\citep{eriksson20} but also for assimilating cloud-contaminated observations in
numerical weather prediction models \citep{geer17}.


%So far, direct efforts to validate sub-millimeter radiative transfer through
%clouds at frequencies exceeding $183\ \unit{GHz}$ have been limited by the
%availability of such observations and the difficulty of accurately representing
%observed clouds and background atmosphere in the simulations. In the upper
%troposphere, observations of clouds have been obtained as by-products of
%space-borne limb-sounding missions aimed to study gases in the stratosphere.
%Retrievals of ice mass concentrations using sub-millimeter limb-sounding
%observations were developed for AURA MLS \citep{wu06}, Odin/SMR
%\citep{eriksson07} and SMILES \citep{millan13, eriksson14}. However, due to
%their geometry the observations are limited to very high clouds in the tropics.
%Other sources of sub-millimeter observations of clouds are airborne sensors with
%sub-millimeter channels such as the Millimeter-wave imaging radiometer (MIR,
%\citet{wang01}), the Compact Scanning Submillimeter Imaging Radiometer (CoSSIR,
%\citet{evans05}) and the International Sub-Millimeter Airborne Radiometer
%(ISMAR, \citet{fox17}). To the best knowledge of the authors, there are so far
%only two notable efforts to validate microphysical assumptions involved in
%sub-millimeter radiative transfer simulations: Firstly, the study by
%\citet{evans05}, who use a Bayesian retrieval to retrieve integrated radar
%backscatter of a convective anvil and achieve good agreement with simultaneous
%radar measurements at $90\ \unit{GHz}$. And secondly, the study by
%\citet{fox18}, who perform a closure study based on lidar and in-situ
%observations of hydrometeors in a mid-latitude cirrus cloud.


In this study, the synergistic retrieval is applied to co-located radar and
microwave radiometer observations of three mid-latitude cloud systems. For two
of the flights, retrieved hydrometeor distributions are compared to in-situ
measurements of bulk ice water content (IWC) and particle size distributions
(PSDs). Since the shape of ice particles is difficult to constrain a priori, the
retrieval is run multiple times while the ice particle shape assumed in the
radiative transfer simulations is varied. This allows us to asses the retrieval
accuracy and the sensitivity of the results to the assumed ice particle shape.
Furthermore, we compare the fitted forward simulations to the real observations,
which allows us to asses the consistency of the radiative transfer modeling
across the different sensors and frequencies used in the retrieval. Furthermore,
through the comparison of the retrieved atmospheric state with the in-situ
measurements we can asses the agreement of input of the radiative transfer model
with the actual atmospheric state and thus the overall consistency between
simulations and observations.

The remainder of this article is structured as follows:
Section~\ref{sec:methods_and_data} contains a description of the data as well as
the retrieval algorithm that is applied to the remote sensing observations.
Section~\ref{sec:results} presents the results of the retrieval as well as the
comparisons to in-situ data followed by a discussion of those result in
Sec.~\ref{sec:discussion} and conclusions in~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

\end{figure}

The combined retrieval algorithm used in this study retrieves distributions of
ice hydrometeors by combining radar and microwave radiometer observations. The
passive observations are taken from the the MARSS \citep{mcgrath01} and ISMAR
\citep{fox17} radiometers on board the UK’s BAe-146-301 Atmospheric Research
Aircraft (FAAM BAe-146) aircraft. The instrumentation of the FAAM aircraft does
not include a cloud radar which is why only flights for which the radiometer
observations can be co-located with radar observations from another platform are
suitable for the combined retrieval. Since ISMAR is currently the only
operational radiometer with channels up to $664$ and $874\ \unit{GHz}$, the
flights considered in this study provide a rare opportunity to study the
synergies between radar and passive (sub-)millimeter observations using real
observations.
An overview of the three flights and the corresponding meteorological contexts
is provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:flight_overview}. The first considered flight,
designated B984, took place on 14 October 2016 as part of the North Atlantic
Waveguide and Downstream Impact Experiment (NAWDEX, \citet{schafler18}). During
this flight, a cloud system generated by an occluded front has been observed
quasi-simultaneously by three research aircraft: The High Altitude and Long
Range Research Aircraft (HALO, \citet{krautstrunk12}), the FAAM BAe-146 and the
Falcon 20 of the Service des Avions Francais Instrumentations pour la Recherche
en Environnement (SAFIRE).

The two other flights, designated C159 and C161 respectively, took place in
March 2019 as part of the PIKNMIX-F campaign. These two flights were performed
following the ground track of simultaneous overpasses of the CloudSat satellite.
The observations probe clouds in different regions of a frontal system generated
by a low-pressure system passing over Iceland around the 21st of March 2019. The
cloud system observed during flight C159 is a stratiform, lightly-precipitating
cloud located in the warm sector of the fronal system, whereas the clouds
observed during flight C161 are of convective origin and located in the active
region of the cold front.

\subsection{Radar observations}

The radar observations from the three flights are displayed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:observations_radar}. Observations for flight B984 stem from the
HAMP MIRA radar \citep{mech14} onboard the HALO aircraft, which operates at a
frequency of $35\ \unit{GHz}$ and has been characterized and calibrated by
\citep{ewald19}. Its observations have been downsampled to a vertical resolution
of $210\ \unit{m}$ and a horizontal resolution of roughly $700\ \unit{m}$ in
order to reduce the computational complexity of the retrieval and to better
match the field of view of the passive observations, which, at an altitude of
$5\ \unit{km}$, vary between about $900\ \unit{m}$ for the low- frequency
channels and $200\ \unit{m}$ for the high-frequency channels.

The radar observations for flights C159 and C161 stem from the CloudSat Cloud
Profiling Radar (CPR, \citet{tanelli08}), which operates at $94\ \unit{GHz}$.
Since the CloudSat observations were affected strongly by ground-clutter, the
first five bins located completely above surface altitude were set to the
reflectivity found in the sixth bin above the surface. The CPR observations
have a vertical resolution of $240\ \unit{m}$ and a horizontal resolution of
$1.4\ \unit{km}$ . The horizontal distance between subsequent observations is
$1.1\ \unit{km}$.

    CloudSat CPR at $94\ \unit{GHz}$. The white line displays the ERA5 freezing
    level from \citet{era5}. }
  \label{fig:observations_radar}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{MARSS}

The MARSS radiometer measures microwave radiances at $89, 157$ and channels
located around the water vapor line at $183 \unit{GHz}$. Although MARSS is a
scanning radiometer only observations within $5\ \unit{^\circ}$ off nadir are
used in the retrieval. The observations from the three flights are displayed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:observations_marss}. Flight sections above land surfaces have been
highlighted in the plots because observations that are strongly affected by
surface emissions are not used in the retrieval. For the MARSS sensor this is
the case for the window channels at $89$ and $157\ \unit{GHz}$. The MARSS
observations were mapped to the radar observations using nearest-neighbor
interpolation.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../plots/observations_marss.png}
  \caption{
    Passive microwave measurements from the MARSS radiometer together with the

    observations that were taken over land and are therefore not used in
    the retrieval.
    }
  \label{fig:observations_marss}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{ISMAR}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../plots/observations_ismar.png}
  \caption{
    Passive microwave measurements from the ISMAR radiometer together with the

    observations that were taken over land and are therefore not used in
    the retrieval.
    }
  \label{fig:observations_ismar}
\end{figure}

The ISMAR radiometer has channels covering the frequency range from
$118\ \unit{GHz}$ up to $874\ \unit{GHz}$. As for MARSS, only observations
within $5\unit{^\circ}$ degrees off nadir are used in the retrieval. The
observations from the 3 flights are displayed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:observations_ismar}. Similar as for the two lowest frequency
channels of MARSS, the 4 outermost channels around the $118\ \unit{GHz}$ oxygen
line are not used over land. The matching of ISMAR observations to radar
observations is performed in the same way as for MARSS. As illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:observations_ismar}, not all channels were available on all
flights. The channels around $448$ and $874\ \unit{GHz}$ were not available on
the B984 flight, while the two of the channels around $325\ \unit{GHz}$ were
missing for the C159 and C161 flights.


\subsection{In-situ measurements}
\label{sec:in_situ}

In-situ measurements of cloud hydrometeors were performed during the flights
B984 and C159. A detailed view of the high-level runs and the corresponding
in-situ sampling paths are provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:flight_overview_detail}.
For flight C159, this view reveals a noticeable horizontal offset of $3$ to
$\SI{4}{\kilo \meters}$ between the ground track of radar and radiometer
observations and even larger deviations between the lower parts of the
in-situ sampling flight path and the high-level run.


\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../plots/flight_overview_detail.png}

    paths for flights B984 and C159. The backound is the true-color composite
    derived from the closest overpasses of the MODIS \citep{modis} sensor
    on the Aqua satellite.
    }
  \label{fig:flight_overview_detail}
\end{figure}

The in-situ measurements that are relevant to this study are bulk ice water
content measured using a Nevzorov hot-wire probe \citep{korolev13} and PSDs
recorded using DMT CIP-15 and CIP-100 probes, which measure size-resolved
particle concentrations with resolutions of 15 and $100\ \unit{\mu m}$,
respectively. The in-situ measurements were mapped to corresponding radar
observations using a nearest-neighbor criterion.

An overview of the measured IWC and PSDs is provided in
Fig.~\ref{fig:in_situ}. The first row of panels in the figure displays the IWC
measured by the Nevzorov probe along the in-situ sampling path on top of the
corresponding radar observations. For flight B984, the measured IWC correlates
well with the corresponding radar reflectivities. This, however, is not the case
for flight C159, indicating that radar observations and in-situ measurements may
not be well co-located.

    measured PSDs (red) together with randomly sampled instances (light-grey)
    over different altitudes.
    }
  \label{fig:in_situ}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Retrieval algorithm}
\label{sec:synergistic_retrieval}

The synergistic retrieval algorithm used in this study is based on the optimal
estimation framework \citep{rodgers00} and retrieves distributions of frozen and
liquid hydrometeors together with water vapor by simultaneously fitting a
forward model to the active and passive observations. Since the algorithm is
described in detail in \citet{pfreundschuh20} the following section only
outlines its main features and how it has been adapted to the flight data.

The retrieval input consists of a single radar profile and the corresponding
closest radiometer observations. Background properties of atmosphere and
surface, such as temperature and wind speed, as well as a priori profiles for
relative humidity and liquid cloud water are taken from the ERA5 hourly
reanalysis \citp{era5}.

The retrieval forward model has been adjusted to the flight measurements by
adapting the forward model to the sensors that were available for each flight.
The atmospheric grid was limited to altitudes between $0$ and $10 \unit{km}$ and
matched to the resolution of the radar observations. The latest stable release
(version 2.4) of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS,
\citet{arts18}) is used to implement the forward model used in the retrieval.
ARTS' built-in single-scattering radar solver is used to calculate radar
observations and Jacobians. To account for the effect of multiple scattering in
CloudSat observations, the attenuation due to hydrometeors is scaled at each
atmospheric layer by a factor of $0.5$ following Fig.~16 in \citet{battaglia10}.
Passive radiances are calculated using the ARTS interface to DISORT
\citep{disort00} and their Jacobians are approximated using a first order
scattering approximation. Gaseous absorption is modeled using the absorption
models from \cite{rosenkranz93} for $N_2$, $O_2$. Following \citet{fox20},
absorption from water varpor is calculated using a combination of the AER
database v3.6 \citep{aer36} for resonant absorption and the MT-CKD model for
continuum absorption \citep{mlawer12}.

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Representation of frozen hydrometeors}

The forward model simulates active and passive observations in two steps: In the
first one, the hydrometeor bulk properties that are used to represent the
hydrometeors in the retrieval are mapped to corresponding optical properties.
The optical properties are then, in the second step, used together with
background atmosphere and surface to simulate the observations. Since both the
particle shape and distribution of ice particles vary extensively, the mapping
of hydrometeor bulk properties to optical properties of ice particles is
affected by significant uncertainties, particularly at sub-millimeter
wavelengths.

To map the hydrometeor bulk properties to optical properties, the forward model
uses a particle size distribution (PSD) that is parametrized by the bulk
properties, which is combined with an ice particle model that maps particle
sizes to shapes and corresponding optical properties. More specifically, the
forward model uses the normalized PSD approach proposed by \citet{delanoe05},
which is based on a modified gamma distribution parametrized by mass-weighted
mean diameter ($D_m$) and intercept parameter ($N_0^*$). The updated values from
\citet{cazenave19} are used as shape parameters of the distribution. The PSD is
combined with a (particle) habit, which consists of a sequence of ice particle
shapes of varying sizes and corresponding pre-computed optical properties. Bulk
optical properties are calculated by integrating the product of particle density
and optical properties over the particle size. As the retrieval is currently set
up, the particle habit cannot be retrieved and must be assumed a priori. Since
the choice of particle habit considerably affects the retrieval results, a
set of habits has been chosen with which the retrieval will be run in order to
investigate their impact.

Five habits were chosen from the set of standard habits that are distributed
with the ARTS SSDB \citep{eriksson18}. The standard habits are particle mixes
that combine pristine crystals at small sizes with aggregate shapes at larger
sizes. The selected habits are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:particle_habits}. To
provide an overview of their optical properties, characteristic bulk optical
properties have been calculated and displayed in \ref{fig:particle_properties}
together with their mass-size relationships. The assumed PSD is same that is
used in the retrieval with the $N_0^*$ value set to the a priori value at a
temperature of $\SI{260}{\kelvin}$. The particles were selected so that their
properties (colored lines) cover most of the variability of the available set of
standard habits (grey lines), both in terms of the mass-size relationship as
well as their optical properties.

Complementary information that can help guide the selection of a suitable
particle shape can be obtained from in-situ measurements. Since the particle
habit associates particle sizes with a specific shape it can be used to compute
a bulk water content corresponding to PSD measurements. This allows calculating
the IWC corresponding to the in-situ-measured PSDs, which can be compared with
the IWC measured using the Nevzorov probe. The agreement between the PSD-derived
IWC and the directly measured IWC can then provide insight into whether the
mass-size relation corresponding to the particle shape is consistent with the
in-situ measurements. Such a comparison is provided in
Fig.~\ref{fig:mass_size_relation}.

For both flights, the Large Plate Aggregate shape and the 6-Bullet Rosette agree
best with the directly measured IWC. The Large Column Aggregate yields values at
the low end of the measured distribution for all flights and altitudes. The
Evans Snow Aggregate yields similar results to those of the Large Column
Aggregate except at high altitudes for flight B984 and low altitudes for
flight C159. The 8-Column Aggregate generally yields higher IWC values
than most particles and tends to overestimates the in-situ IWC at low
altitudes for flight B984.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

While the primary results of the combined retrieval are the retrieved
hydrometeor distributions, the retrieval also produces fits a radiative transfer
model to the observations whose agreement with the real observations can provide
valuable information regarding the accuracy of the forward model and the fitness
of a priori and modeling assumptions. The retrieval results that were obtained
by running the retrieval for each combination of flights and selected particle
habits are presented in this section. Furthermore, the results are compared to
in-situ measurements for the two flight for which those have been available.


\subsection{Fit to observations}

The retrieval residuals, i.e. the difference between simulated and real
observations, for Large Plate Aggregate habit are displayed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:residuals}. As the figure shows, the retrieval was able to fit
both radar and radiometer observations fairly well for all flights. For flight
B984, the radar residuals show some scattered deviations located at the edge of
the cloud, which are likely discretization artifacts. Except for that, residuals
for this flight remain well within $1\ \unit{dB}$. The residuals for flight
C159, exhibit four vertical stripes with significant residuals in the radar
observations. In these regions, which correspond to significant scattering
depressions in most of passive channels up to $325\ \unit{GHz}$, the simulations
overestimate the radar reflectivity. Apart from this, there are some smaller
regions where the simulations underestimate the radar reflectivity but these
remain limited to within few $\unit{dB}$. Similar albeit stronger patterns are
observed for flight C161, which exhibits negative residuals in the right half of
the convective core.


Radiometer residuals for flight B984 are mostly within $\pm 5\ \unit{K}$. For
the two other flights the residuals are larger. Differences up to and exceeding
$10\ \unit{K}$ are observed at the window channels up to $247\ \unit{GHz}$ as
well as in the outermost channels around the absorption lines at
$118\ \unit{GHz}$ and $183\ \unit{GHz}$. Since these correspond to profiles in
which residuals of opposite sign are present in the radar observations, a likely
explanation is that they are caused by small-scale precipitation events that are
missed by one of the sensors due to co-location issues.


\begin{figure}[!hbpt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{../plots/retrieval_residuals}
  \caption{Differences between observed and fitted observations for the Large
    Plate Aggregate particle. First two rows depict the radar observations and
    their residuals, respectively. Following rows show the retrieval residual in
    the radiometer measurements for each of the frequency bands used in the
    retrieval. Grey shading marks observations of land surfaces. }
  \label{fig:residuals}
\end{figure}

For a more systematic analysis of the effect of the assumed particle shape on
the retrieval residuals, their distribution for radar and radiometer channels
around $183\ \unit{GHz}$ and above are displayed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:residuals_box}. The distributions, which for most channels are
close to or centered around zero, confirm that the retrieval generally fits the
observations well. The largest deviations are observed for the $874\ \unit{GHz}$
channel and the $243\ \unit{GHz}$ channel for flight C161. For flights C159 and
C161, the $874$ and $664\ \unit{GHz}$ channels exhibit small systematic biases
of opposite signs, which may indicate issues with the modeling of water vapor
absorption at these channels. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the
ice particle habit only has a minor impact on the residuals indicating that the
retrieval can compensate for mismatches in the assumed particle shape by
adjusting the retrieval variables.

  \caption{Distributions of retrieval residuals for different particle
    shapes used in the forward model for each of the three flights.}
  \label{fig:residuals_box}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Retrieved ice water content}

The retrieved bulk IWC and corresponding IWP for all three cloud scenes are
displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:ice_water_content}. For all three flights, the ice
particle shape has a significant effect on the retrieved water content. In terms
of IWP, the Large-Column Aggregate and Evans Snow Aggregate habits yield the
highest values across all flights, while the 8-Column Aggregate Consistently
Yields the lowest IWP. The Large Plate Aggregate and 6-Bullet Rosette both yield
values within the range of the other particle models, with the 6-Bullet Rosette
leading to slightly higher IWP values than the Large Plate Aggregate. In
addition to the effect of the increased total retrieved water content, the
particle habit also has a small effect on the vertical distribution of the ice
hydrometeors, which is visible particularly for retrieved IWC in the convective
core observed during flight C161.


\begin{figure}[!hbpt]

  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../plots/ice_water_content}
  \caption{Retrieved IWP and IWC content for all flights and different ice
    particle shapes assumed in the retrieval. The white line displays the ERA5
    freezing level from \citet{era5}.
  }
  \label{fig:ice_water_content}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Comparison to in-situ measurements}

The most important question regarding the hydrometeor retrieval is certainly
whether the retrieved bulk properties are consistent with the in-situ
measurements. As mentioned in Sec.~\ref{sec:in_situ}, the in-situ measurements
were mapped to the radar observations using a nearest-neighbor criterion. For
B984, retrieval results within a distance of 1km of the flight path were then
associated to the in-situ measurements. Because of the mismatch between
observations and in-situ sampling paths, another approach was taken for flight
C159. Here the retrieval results were mapped to the in-situ measurements by
selecting all retrieval results between $50$ and $150\ \unit{km}$ along-track
distance. Both, the matched retrieval results and the vertically-resolved
distributions of measured and retrieved IWC are displayed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:in_situ_iwc}.

For flight B984, the distribution of in-situ-measured IWC values is well within
the range of retrieved IWC values across all particle shapes up to an altitude
of around $7\ \unit{km}$. Below that altitude, the best match to the in-situ
measurements is achieved with the 6-Bullet Rosette particle and the Large Plate
Aggregate. The 8-column aggregate underestimates the in-situ-measured IWC while
Large Column Aggregate and Evans Snow Aggregate overestimate it. Above around
$6\ \unit{km}$ all particles lead to results that underestimate the
in-situ-measured IWC. A likely cause for this, is the high concentration of
small particles as observed in the in-situ measurements (c.f.
Fig.~\ref{fig:in_situ}) and for which the microwave observations lack
sensitivity.

For flight C159 the distribution of retrieved IWC still covers the distribution
of in-situ-measured values but shows a tendency towards underestimation.
Overall, difference between habits are smaller for this flight. However, the
large uncertainties caused by the large sampling region as well as the potential
co-location issues that affect the results make them less conclusive.

\begin{figure}[!hbpt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../plots/in_situ_iwc}
  \caption{In-situ-measured and retrieved IWC for flights B984
    and C159. The first row of panels shows the in-situ sampling paths in
    relation to the measured radar reflectivity and marked by the
    blue shading the retrieval values that are mapped to the
    in-situ measurements. The second row of panels shows in the background
    the distribution of in-situ measured IWC values in altitude bins with
    a height of $500\ \unit{m}$. Colored boxes display the corresponding
    distribution of retrieved IWC values for different ice particle shapes.}
  \label{fig:in_situ_iwc}
\end{figure}

Finally, we want to address the question whether the representation of cloud
microphysics within the retrieval forward model is consistent with the in-situ
measured distributions of hydrometeors. For this, we calculate the PSDs
corresponding to the retrieved bulk properties and compare them to the in-situ
measured PSDs. The results of the comparison are displayed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:in_situ_psds}. Similar as for the bulk water content the retrieved
PSDs match the in-situ measured ones quite well for flight B984 but show
systematic deviations for flight C159. For flight B984, we find a good agreement
between retrieved and in-situ-measured PSDs for particles sizes $> 200
\ \unit{\mu m}$ for the Large Plate Aggregate and the 6-Bullet Rosette. The fact
that this is observed even at altitudes above $6 \ \unit{km}$ confirms that the
underestimation of IWC is likely caused by the high concentration of smaller ice
particles.

    measured PSDs (light grey) for a given altitude bin of a height of one
    kilometer. Colored lines on top show the corresponding mean retrieved PSD
    for different assumed particle shapes.}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

This study used a variational retrieval to retrieve vertically-resolved
distributions of ice hydrometeors from co-located radar and microwave radiometer
observations. For most of the considered channels, the retrieval succeeded in
fitting both the active and passive observations without significant, systematic
deviations. For two of the flights, the retrieved hydrometeor distributions
could be compared to in-situ measurements. For one of the flights (B984), we
found good agreement with the in-situ-measured bulk IWC for altitudes between
$2$ and $6\ \unit{km}$ for two of the particle shapes. The same particle shapes
also yield the best agreements with the in-situ-measured PSDs for particle sizes
$D_\text{max} > 200\ \unit{\mu m}$. For the second flight (C159), no consistency
was found between the in-situ-measurements and the retrieval. A likely
explanation for this is that the in-situ measurements are not as well co-located
due to the temporal and spatial differences between the different observations
and the in-situ measurements.

\subsection{Sub-millimeter radiative transfer in cloudy atmospheres}

 A first important result of this study is the ability of the retrieval to find
 atmospheric states that are consistent with the observed radiances and radar
 reflectivities for all three flights. This in itself is not self-evident due to
 the uncertainties that still affect the modeling of ice-particle scattering
 across millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. Previous studies that tried
 to directly validate sub-millimeter RT through clouds were either limited to
 tropical clouds \citep{evans05, eriksson07} or cirrus clouds \citep{fox17}.

 For flight B984, the radar and all passive observations were fitted up to small
 systematic biases no larger than $3\ \unit{K}$. The deviations for the two
 other flights were generally larger, but these were likely caused by spatial
 and temporal co-location errors. The small residuals that were achieved for
 flight B984 indicate that both, the assumed optical properties as well as the
 retrieval forward model, are consistent across the simulated wavelengths.
 Moreover, the two particle shapes for which the best agreement between
 retrieved and in-situ-measured hydrometeor distributions was found were also
 those whose mass-size relationship yield the best agreement between in-situ
 measurements of IWC and PSDs. This indicates that microphysical and optical
 properties of those particles are realistically represented in the ARTS SSDB.

\subsection{The impact of assumed ice particle shape}

A rather unexpected result that emerged from this study is that the retrieval
can fit the observations regardless of the assumed ice particle shape. This
indicates that although the observations are sensitive to variations in ice
particle shape, they alone cannot constrain it. This is in agreement with what
has been reported in \citet{pfreundschuh20}, namely that no correlation could be
found between the particle shape yielding best retrieval fit and the one
yielding the most accurate retrieval results.

In an effort to better separate a potential signal from the ice particle shape
in the retrieval residuals, Fig.~\ref{fig:residuals_scatter} in the appendix
displays the relation between IWP and corresponding residuals in the $325 \pm
3.5 \unit{GHz}$ channel. This channel was chosen because it belongs to the
channels displaying the largest differences between residual distributions for
different particle habits (Fig.~\ref{fig:residuals_box}). Nonetheless, the
plots exhibit no sign of a relationship between either residual and ice
water content or the residuals across different habits.

This result implies that upcoming retrieval of ice hydrometeor based on
millimeter and sub-millimeter microwave observations must either account for the
uncertainty caused by variations in ice particle shape or find ways to more
accurately constrain the shape a priori. Moreover, for studies that seek to
validate model predictions by comparing simulated and observed microwave
observations, this implies that care must be taken to accurately characterize
the ice particle shape since consistency between simulations and observations
can be achieved for bulk water contents that vary by almost an order of
magnitude (c.f. \ref{fig:ice_water_content}).

\subsection{Representation of cloud microphysics}

The lack of a signal that constrains the ice particle shape even in the combined
observations puts additional weight on the question of how to best represent ice
particles in simulations of microwave observations. The habits that yielded the
most accurate retrieval results in this study were the Large Plate Aggregate and
the 6-Bullet Rosette. It is interesting to note that the Large Plate Aggregate
was also found to yield the best agreement between NWP-model-based simulations
and satellite observations at frequencies between $19$ and $190\ \unit{GHz}$ for
stratiform snow in \citet{geer21}.

Nonetheless, these findings are based on observations from the single flight for
which the retrieval results could be reliably compared with in-situ
measurements. This result can thus be seen as indication that these habits may
work well for similar mid-latitude cloud systems but more generally applicable
conclusions would require further and more systematic investigation.

\subsection{Retrieval validation}

Since the results presented in \citet{pfreundschuh20} were limited to
simulations based on a high-resolution climate model, the validation of the
retrieval using real observations remained an open issue. For flight, B984 good
agreement was found between retrieval results and in-situ measurements. Although
the retrieved IWC deviates from the in-situ measurements at altitudes $>
6\ \unit{km}$, the retrieved PSDs still match the in-situ measurements well for
particles with $D_\text{max} > 200\ \unit{\mu m}$. This indicates that the
observed deviations are due to the presence of a large number of small ice
particles that the microwave observations are not sensitive to.

Although \citet{oshea21} and \citet{oshea19} show that the occurence of high
particle concentrations at sizes below $200\ \unit{\mu m}$ may be due to
measurement inaccuracies of the CIP-15 probe, the measured PSDs correctly
reproduce the measured IWC at these altitudes when the corresponding water
content is calculated using any of the tested particle habits
(Fig.~\ref{fig:mass_size_relation}). Furthermore, the presence of a cloud layer
with a large number of small particles was also reported by \citet{ewald21} who
investigated the same cloud system with combined radar-lidar observations.

For flight C159 no good agreement was found between retrieved and
in-situ-measured IWC and PSDs. However, some evidence suggest that
this is due to co-location issues rather than failure of the retrieval
algorithm. Firstly, the flight path for the in-situ sampling was found to be
offset from the high-level run during which the observations were taken in the
direction opposite to the wind at $800\ \unit{mb}$
(Fig.~\ref{fig:flight_overview}, Fig.~\ref{fig:flight_overview_detail}).
Secondly, there are visible disparities between the in-situ measured IWC and the
radar reflectivities where there is no IWC present in the in-situ measurements
although the radar observations clearly show a backscattering signal
(Fig.~\ref{fig:in_situ_iwc}). Thirdly, the residuals observed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:residuals} are indicative of co-location issues between radar and
radiometer observations.

\subsection{The added value synergistic cloud retrievals}

Although the evidence from flight B984 suggests that the synergistic
retrieval algorithm works well for retrieving ice hydrometeor concentrations,
similar retrievals can be performed using only radar observations. A retrieval
using only radar observations has the obvious advantage of requiring only
a single sensor and being computationally much less complex.

To investigate the added value of the combined observations for the retrieval of
ice hydrometeors, the results of the combined and an equivalent radar-only
retrieval for flight B984 are displayed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:in_situ_iwc_radar_only}. For the Large Plate Aggregate and
6-Bullet-Rosette habits, the results of the combined and the radar-only
retrieval are largely similar down to an altitude of about $3.5\ \unit{km}$
below which the radar-only retrieval tends to overestimate the in-situ IWC. In
contrast to the combined retrieval, the results of the radar-only retrieval
exhibit almost no impact from the particle habit. So while the radar-only
retrieval remains mostly unaffected by the habit choice, using a different
habit in the combined retrieval may cause systematic overestimation (Evans Snow
Aggregate and Large Column Aggregate) or underestimation (8-Column Aggregate).

\begin{figure}[!hbpt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../plots/in_situ_iwc_radar_only}
  \caption{In-situ-measured and retrieved PSDs for flight B984
    for the combined and the radar-only retrieval. Each panel displays
    the distributions of in-situ-measured IWC for different altitude
    bins in the background and the distribution of retrieved IWC values
    for different ice habits as colored boxes on top.}
  \label{fig:in_situ_iwc_radar_only}
\end{figure}

A similar comparison is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:in_situ_psds_radar_only} for the
retrieved PSDs. The PSDs are similar for both retrievals for altitudes above
$4\ \unit{km}$. Below that, however, the radar-only retrieval over estimates the
particle concentrations, while the combined retrieval matches the in-situ
measurements well for the Large Plate Aggregate and 6-Bullet Rosette habits.
This indicates that the combined retrieval utilizes the complementary
information in the radar and passive observations to match both moments of the
PSD, whereas the radar-only retrieval can only match one of them. This indicates
that although a radar-only retrieval may produce fairly accurate measurements
of IWC, cannot accurately represent the microphysical properties of the
hydrometeors.

\begin{figure}[!hbpt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../plots/in_situ_psds_radar_only}

    PSDs (black) together with randomly drawn samples of measured PSDs
    (light grey) for a given altitude bin of a height of one kilometer.
    Colored lines on top show the corresponding mean retrieved PSD for
    different assumed particle shapes.}
  \label{fig:in_situ_psds_radar_only}
\end{figure}

These results thus suggest that combining radar with passive microwave
observations helps to constrain the PSD of ice hydrometeors at the base of
clouds. Since for air- and space-borne observations only microwave observations
can sense the base of thick clouds, this points towards a unique synergy between
these types of observations.

\subsection{Limitations}

Since microwave radiative transfer simulations in cloudy atmospheres remain a
challenging problem, it is important to also consider the limitations of the
simulations and derived results that were presented in this study. The
simplifications that were applied in the simulations are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Photon transport between adjacent columns is ignored.
  \item Inhomogeneity across the radar and radiometer beams is ignored.
  \item The finite spectral resolution of the passive channels is neglected.
  \item The radar solver neglects multiple scattering.
  \item The effects of particle orientation are ignored.
\end{enumerate}

\citet{barlakas20} found that neglecting photon transport in simulations of
sub-millimeter observations across a footprint of $6\ \unit{km}$ incurs only a
small random error with biases $< 0.5\ \unit{K}$, so it is likely also small for
the simulations presented here. For flight B984 the horizontal averaging of the
radar observations leads to a profile width of $700\ \unit{m}$ which is fairly
close to the width of the radiometer field of views which varies between about
$900$ and $200\ \unit{m}$ at an altitude of $5\ \unit{km}$. The effect of beam
inhomogeneity is therefore expected to be small for this flight. For flights
C159 and C161, the radar beam has an along-track width of about
$1.4\ \unit{km}$, which is larger than that of the radiometers, so these
observations may be affected to a larger extend than those for flight B984.

Neglecting the finite spectral resolution of the passive channels can lead to an
error of up to $2.1\ \unit{K}$ for satellite observations that are affected by
Ozone absorption \citep{eriksson20}. Since the passive observations used in this
study were all taken from altitudes below $10\ \unit{km}$ the effect of this
approximation is likely negligible.

The effect of multiple scattering for air-borne radar observations is generally
negligible \citep{battaglia10}. For CloudSat observations, however, the higher
frequency and the considerably wider footprint will increase the effects of
multiple scattering on the observations. Although the simulations account for
the signal-enhancing effect of multiple scattering by layer-wise reduction of
the attenuation, the presence of multiple scattering may still add to increased
uncertainty in the simulations for flights C159 and C161.

Finally, there is the potential presence of oriented particles in the cloud. The
different ice habits used in this study all assume totally random orientation of
the ice particles. Systematic orientation of particles of a given shape in the
cloud would effectively alter their scattering properties. For observations at
nadir, particle orientation can increase the extinction of the Large Plate
Aggregate of up to $20\ \unit{\%}$ \citep{barlakas21}. To first order, the
increase in extinction can be expected to cause a similar overestimation of the
retrieved IWC. This, however, is still considerably lower than the differences
observed due to different ice habits.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

The main result from the experiments presented in this study is that we were
able to find two ice particle shapes, the Large Plate Aggregate and the 6-Bullet
Rosette, for which the results of the combined retrieval were consistent with
the observations as well as the in-situ-measured IWC and PSDs for flight B984 .
Considering the co-location issues that affected the other two flights, we
interpret this as a cautious indication of the validity of the retrieval
implementation. Since the ARTS radiative transfer model and optical properties
from the ARTS single-scattering database constitute a crucial component of the
retrieval, this result indirectly also validates those. Although the evidence is
limited, we conclude that both retrieval as well as the radiative
transfer modeling using ARTS and the ARTS single-scattering database work
reliably across the millimeter- and sub-millimeter domain given that ice
hydrometeors are suitably represented in the retrieval.

Furthermore, we found evidence that a synergistic retrieval that uses active and
passive microwave observations can help to better characterize the PSD of ice
hydrometeors at the base of clouds. This indicates that such retrievals can be
used to study the microphysical properties of clouds and thus help to improve
their representation in weather and climate models.


This, however, requires a suitable representation of the ice particle habit in
the retrieval forward model. We found no evidence of a signal that could help to
constrain the ice particle shape based solely on the combination of radar and
microwave observations, not even when sub-millimeter observations are included.
This means that more work is needed to better constrain the shape a priori or
that even more observations must be used in the retrieval. For the MARSS and
ISMAR sensors, which are scanning radiometers, it would be possible to
incorporate additional viewing angles into the retrieval. Making such a
retrieval computationally tractable, however, would require extensive
development of the radiative transfer model used in the retrieval.

Although further work will be required, this study demonstrates the feasibility
and potential of a synergistic retrieval of ice hydrometeors that combines
active and passive observations at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths.
Since the combined retrieval can better constrain the PSD of ice hydrometeors,
it may be used to the formation and representation of clouds in NWP and climate
models. Furthermore, the results from flight B984 demonstrate the potential of
the retrieval to systematically study the representation of ice hydrometeors in
radiative transfer simulations, which will be vital to many applications of
observations from upcoming sub-millimeter sensors such as ICI and the Arctic
Weather Satellite.
